## Brief status report for team 09

So far we have
* Ordered inital parts/sensors
* Tested flexible force sensors (to detect weight in fixture) to observe output in a simple circuit
* Tested load cell with ADC and acquired weight measurement of a soda can that matches a kitchen scale
* Made progress with communicating with the ESP32 over WiFi
* Narrowed down options for methods of producing the outputs we need to make the scale work, and the types of components we'll need for the peripheral circuitry

We were feeling a little behind but are grinding to catch up and get ahead. The next glut of parts will be in the mail shortly, and more specific testing is soon to follow.
