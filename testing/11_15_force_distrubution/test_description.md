##This test was intended to observe variation in force reading from the load cell when force is applied at various points on a board attached to the load cell.
* A bottle of rice vinegar was weighed with a kitchen scale as a control.
* The rice vinegar weights 773 g

Maximium variation found in "back" position (indicated in photos) of 765g.
Compared with control of 773, difference of 8g. This shows a maximum error of 0.0176lb.

Conclusion: This is a small amount of error, but can be reduced by reducing size of platform. A more rigid platform will also be used in final design, reducing this error further.
