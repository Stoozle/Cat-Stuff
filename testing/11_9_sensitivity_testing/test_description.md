##This test was intended to observe changes in force sensor sentivity and voltage output, given variations in series resistance.

* Using a 100k potentiometer, Vout is measured from 2V to 5V at min and max range of potentiometer. It just works.

Conclusion: Just add some pots to the board and do some more testing.
